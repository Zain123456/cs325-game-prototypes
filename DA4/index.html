<h2>Get the pizza</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I was watching Teen Titans and it just came to me. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Well I have an icy floor so the player slips around and you have to collect pizza slices.  
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
It was hard to make the cracks to good.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>BeastBoy: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beast_Boy">BeastBoy</a></li>
<li>Pizza: <a href="https://www.kisspng.com/png-pizza-hut-cartoon-clip-art-cartoon-slice-of-pizza-208792/download-png.html">Pizza</a></li>
<li>Crack: <a href="https://pngtree.com/so/wall-cracks">Crack</a></li>
<li>Background: <a href="https://polardispatches.org/warming-waters-in-a-frozen-ocean/">Ice</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I think just like another collecting game that are out there. 
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Beast Boy dropped is pizza on the ice and he is trying to collect all the slices and avoid falling in the ice.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Ice
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used keyboard and random generation 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The player abilities to avoid and collect. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
They will feel the excitement of avoiding the obstacles.  
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player will start at the bottom left and will have to try to collect 5 slice of pizza. The player will have to 
try avoiding all the cracks in the ice or the player fall in. Some cracks maybe hard to see, so the player will have to 
be careful while moving around on the ice.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Do not try to move to fast because you will slip, take your time. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
BeastBoy was walking home after picking up one box of pizza. But he falls and drops the box of pizza. The pizza slices are 
all over the place and there are cracks in the ice. So, BeastBoy will try his best to collect has many slices as he can and 
avoid falling through the ice.  
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Teen Titans fans
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
1 - 2 minutes 
</li>
