<h2>Cat And Mouse</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Tom and Jerry
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I used the keyboard and had the cat follow the mouse.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned that an easy task can be very hard. It took me a long time to get the health to work the way I wanted to.
</li>
