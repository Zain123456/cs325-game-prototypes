<h2>Chicken Lost in Pokemon World</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Came up with an idea for a lost chicken.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
User has to avoid the pokeball, but there are 3 pokeballs and only one is bad.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
It was hard to make the pokeballs rain down and have the user avoid them, but the game was giving the wrong results.
So, I had to just pick one and have the others be a fake
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I used some from the phaser website from thier tutorial and the rest I did my self.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I am not sure, I did not make my game based on another.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Avoid the pokeballs, but only one can hurt you.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
A lost chicken in the pokemon world
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used the keyboard arrows to move the chicken.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The movement and the use of the arrow keys.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
They will the excitement of close calls.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A player can move side to side and up. The players has to avoid the pokeballs as long as possible. If the player makes contact with the pokeball, they lose the game.  
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Pick a side and stay on that side, also avoid jumping up. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The chicken crossed the street and did not know where it was headed. The chicken fell into a blackhole and landed in the pokemon world. Everyone in the pokemon world thinks that the chicken is a pokemon, so 
everyone is trying to catch it. The chicken has to avoid getting caught, so they it can find a way back home.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Pokemon Fans
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Maybe around 2 - 5 minutes
</li>
